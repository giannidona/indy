### INDY

efficient UI components designed specifically for SaaS applications and indie developers. Our components are crafted to save you precious development time, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: building your product.

### HOW TO USE?

Enter the page, search for the component, or request any component by [clicking here](https://x.com/giannidona_dev). Copy the code and paste it into your project.

### FUTURE PLANS

One of the ideas I have is to migrate/create a large part of the components with Shadcn, also to upload the library to npm so it can be installed, to create more components, and to develop pre-landing pages.
